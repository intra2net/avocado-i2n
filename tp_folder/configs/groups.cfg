    # Reused original subtests
    # ------------------------
    # These tests have almost identical parameters with the original Cartesian
    # config variants included in the VT plugin and the test code can be found
    # there too. Since we rely on the original sources as much as possible but
    # have a separate config parsing chain (two in fact, one for test objects
    # and in particular virtual machines and one for test nodes or simply tests)
    # we have to include these original variants here and separate them from our
    # own internal variants. It is advised to change anything here only if you
    # are willing to tinker with the installation process of new vms, keeping
    # modification to the minimum when possible.

    # Any remaining variant here is the main portion of this config defining
    # new test groups or groups of tests covering some funtionality of the
    # product that the test suite is centered around. In our example, we define
    # a "quicktest" variant for some minimal tests that require one basic vm
    # and run some minimal tests on top (tutorial 1 and 2), one "tutorial 3"
    # variant requiring setup for multiple vms and connecting them in a network,
    # and some more advanced tutorials involving GUI tests or external vms.

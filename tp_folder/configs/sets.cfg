# sets.cfg - final test selection

# Final testsuite variants (all, none, or some)
# ---------------------------------------------
# Feel free to add further refinements on what each such selection should
# include (called "set" to differentiate it from the test groups with their
# additional attached meaning of representing a functionality of the final
# product). The only reserved words are "leaves" and "nonleaves" and they
# can be understood as the empty and universal sets of final tests to run.

# sphinx-quickstart on Tue Feb 12 18:27:14 2019.
#
# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its
# containing dir.
#
# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
# autogenerated file.
#
# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
# -> uncommented and currently used (../.. instead of .):
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))

# Add mock modules to integrate better with platforms like ReadTheDocs. Any
# modules that include C code will not be automatically imported in this online
# platform which is understandable for security reasons. So we have to replace
# them with mock modules in order for the build to succeed (we don't expect
# these to be used for the documentation build in normal circumstances anyway).
